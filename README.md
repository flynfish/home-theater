## Introduction

## About This Guide

### Why an Open Guide? Why on GitHub?
This is an open Guide. It’s open to contributions, so, unlike a blog or forum thread, it is living, and can be improved. While a lot of information on this topic is just a Google search away or located on Home Theater forums, it is scattered about in many different places. This document was started by [Kyle Lamy](https://github.com/flynfish). It’s a preliminary version, and no doubt has some errors and shortcomings, but I want to see it evolve.

### Please contribute!

If you have an idea or contribution that might improve this Guide, please
[**file issues or PRs**](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Questions are also welcome (as issues), as they help
us next time we revise the guide.
We gladly credit all contributors.
